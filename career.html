<p>OGPC is an Oregon Statewide Student Code Showcase<br />
It&#39;s known as the Oregon Game Project Challenge<br />
<br />
Why code and attend OGPC?<br />
It will help you get jobs and scholarships. You can tell colleges and employers that you joined a team, submitted your code and presented your work to judges. We expect you to build teams of 2 5 students for the OGPC game challenge<br />
<br />
Students from all over Oregon travel to Monmouth Oregon near Salem in the spring. Students showcase their games and projects. It&#39;s more of a gallery of student code than a competition.<br />
<br />
When: One day, normally the end of May each year. <br />
Who: Students grades 6 to 12 in Oregon<br />
Where: Western Oregon University<br />
574 Church St W, Monmouth, OR <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Qmx63RZ42Hv"> map here</a><br />
