<strong>Codette - Programming Workshop! For young women </strong><br><br>
Free workshop on music and code.<br>
new time: 3pm to 6pm August 15th-16th-17th<br>
new location: Lincoln High School Downtown Portland Oregon<br>

Seeking young women grades 8-11 for Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) <br><br>

My name is Elaine Yang and I am a student at Lincoln High School. I, along with my friend Kelly Han, plan on running a technology camp at Lincoln High School called Codette in partnership with a 4H organization called Tinker Camp over the summer. We are both passionate tech advocates for STEM (science, Technology, engineering, and math) Technology is so prevalent these days that we want to encourage more girls to participate in the fields of STEM. We want to address 8-11th grade girls, regardless of experience (we welcome everyone  as long as they have passion and enthusiasm ;), and we were hoping we could get your students involved in this opportunity to introduce more girls into the world of programming and technology. It is a completely free program, food is provided, and the students  will learn how to make music with code using Python. We want to provide an opportunity for girls to get involved with STEM, and in a comfortable environment, and we hope you will help us spearhead this goal as there are just simply not enough girls represented in STEM!<br><br>
 

We are looking for a maximum of 15 girls and we serve on a first come first serve basis!<br><br>

Here is a google form they  can fill out if they would like to join:<br>
