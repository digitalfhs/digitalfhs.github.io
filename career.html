My name is Sarah Riswick, and I’m a High School Communications Manager with ChickTech in Portland. <br><br>

Our 2018-2019 program kicks-off with a two-day immersive tech weekend at Portland State University on November 10th and 11th. We will host up to 150 high school girls within the Portland Metro Region. Each participant will attend a technology related workshop and leave with a take-home item that they created. After the kickoff weekend, all participants will have the opportunity to attend subsequent events, mentoring, and internship opportunities throughout the school year.  <br><br>


ChickTech is a national nonprofit that engages women of all ages in the technology industry. We build communities, empower participants to see themselves as leaders, and provide networking and mentoring opportunities to create a better tech culture for all.<br><br>

One of our key areas of focus is engaging high school girls in technology through our high school program. Through hands-on events, we seek to engage girls who would not otherwise have thought of themselves as technologists and who would benefit from hands-on activities, mentoring opportunities, and career exposure. They will participate in workshops, led by industry professionals, that include opportunities to learn code, design, robotics, VR (virtual reality), and much more.  <br><br>

We would like to include your students this year as participants. Could we ask you to share our program with your staff? I’ve included information about the program and our nomination process below. Our program has been successful in the Portland area due to dedicated educators and support from families and businesses alike. As partners, school educators are an instrumental part of ChickTech. We appreciate your willingness to help us serve the girls who need us the most.  <br><br>

Feel free to email me personally email me (below) or call my cell at 310-463-5188 with any questions about the ChickTech program or the nomination process. There is additional information about our high school program on our Portland website.<br><br>

Thank you for your time and consideration!<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Sarah Riswick<br>
High School Communications Manager, ChickTech Portland<br>

About the ChickTech High School Program:<br>
ChickTech is a non-profit dedicated to getting more girls and women into technology related careers through hands-on events. Our High School program provides monthly tech workshops and mentorship from industry experts for girls in 9th-12th grade. 
<br><br>
 
A crucial aspect of our program is finding young women who would not otherwise have thought of a career in tech. As educators, many of you have seen young women not reach their potential in STEM because they thought it was too difficult—or it wasn’t what they’ve seen women do. By asking educators to hand-select our participants, we are giving our participants a vote of confidence. People who know them, and their abilities, have nominated them for this exclusive opportunity! Our large events tend to fill up and have waiting lists, so we encourage you to get your list in ASAP to give your students the best chance of getting in.
<br><br>
Participants are girls, transgender, or non-binary students

SPARK contestants will have the opportunity to submit for “best overall app” for a cash prize of  $25,000. Other prizes that will be awarded to individuals/teams are in the categories of best app design ($1,000), best prototype app ($2,000) and best production level app ($5,000). These three prizes will be awarded separately for high school, undergraduate and graduate individuals/teams.<br><br>

<strong>Codette   Programming Workshop! For young women </strong><br><br>
Free workshop on music and code.<br>
new time: 3pm to 6pm August 15th 16th 17th<br>
new location: Lincoln High School Downtown Portland Oregon<br>

Seeking young women grades 8 11 for Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) <br><br>

My name is Elaine Yang and I am a student at Lincoln High School. I, along with my friend Kelly Han, plan on running a technology camp at Lincoln High School called Codette in partnership with a 4H organization called Tinker Camp over the summer. We are both passionate tech advocates for STEM (science, Technology, engineering, and math) Technology is so prevalent these days that we want to encourage more girls to participate in the fields of STEM. We want to address 8 11th grade girls, regardless of experience (we welcome everyone  as long as they have passion and enthusiasm ;), and we were hoping we could get your students involved in this opportunity to introduce more girls into the world of programming and technology. It is a completely free program, food is provided, and the students  will learn how to make music with code using Python. We want to provide an opportunity for girls to get involved with STEM, and in a comfortable environment, and we hope you will help us spearhead this goal as there are just simply not enough girls represented in STEM!<br><br>
 

We are looking for a maximum of 15 girls and we serve on a first come first serve basis!<br><br>

Here is a google form they  can fill out if they would like to join:<br>
