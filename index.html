Hello, this is Stephen, Freshmen at FHS, <br><br>
I am the Co-Chair of the Education/Youth Voice Committee from the Multnomah Youth Commision. This Email is basically about spreading the word of this event:<br><br>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/348597498982674/?active_tab=discussion">

MYC or Multnomah Youth Commission is a commission that deals with youth problems.

Some issues facing youth:<br>
- get access to TriMet<br>
- elping stop police brutality violence that affects youth, <br>
- helping people get educated. <br>
- Any issue you send me

 I am part of the Education/YV committee of MYC. The Multnomah Youth Commissionâ€™s Education/Youth Voice committee strives to advocate for educational issues and to represent youth voice in the City and County. Four years ago, our committee hosted our first Youth Candidate Forum. The Youth Candidate Forum is meant for ages 13-21. Candidates are running for positions in the county, city and even for the sheriff department. Youth are able to ask questions and at the end, they will get to vote for who they want for that certain position. Even though youth really don't get the final vote for who gets which position, from our experience, the candidate usual holds the position that the youth voted for. We thought that it had a really big impact on spreading youths voice in general and showed that they had a big impact in their communities.<br><br>
 
We would like you to spread the word about this event and come to support The RSVP can be done by parents, teachers, and students. We appreciate it if you spread it to mostly to ages 13-21 ( They are the ones mostly participating). Thank you for spending your time reading this email.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
